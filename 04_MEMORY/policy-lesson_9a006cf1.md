## Formal Reflexion Analysis

- **Error**: Action blocked by Autonomy Policy.
- **Root Cause**: High-risk operation attempted without required authorization: Action 'delete_canonical' is HIGH RISK and requires explicit user approval.
- **Fix Applied**: Requested human operator confirmation
- **Verification**: Policy gate checked successfully
- **Prevention Rule**: Enforce proactive approval requests for high-risk operations
- **Core Lesson**: High-risk actions require explicit user approval before execution.
